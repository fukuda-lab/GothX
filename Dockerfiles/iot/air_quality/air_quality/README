Data Set Information:
The dataset contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from
an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality
Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a
significantly polluted area, at road level,within an Italian
city. Data were recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 (one
year)representing the longest freely available recordings of on field
deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. Ground Truth
hourly averaged concentrations for CO, Non Metanic Hydrocarbons,
Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and
were provided by a co-located reference certified analyzer. Evidences
of cross-sensitivities as well as both concept and sensor drifts are
present as described in De Vito et al., Sens. And Act. B,
Vol. 129,2,2008 (citation required) eventually affecting sensors
concentration estimation capabilities. Missing values are tagged with
-200 value.  This dataset can be used exclusively for research
purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.
