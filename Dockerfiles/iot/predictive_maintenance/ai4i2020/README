Data Set Information:

Since real predictive maintenance datasets are generally difficult to
obtain and in particular difficult to publish, we present and provide
a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance
encountered in industry to the best of our knowledge.

Field separator ","
Decimal separator "."

UDI			int	unique identifier ranging from 1 to 10000
Product ID		str	consisting of a letter L, M, or H for low (50% of all products), medium (30%) and high (20%) as product quality variants and a variant-specific serial number
Type			str	L, M or H
Air temperature [K]	float	generated using a random walk process later normalized to a standard deviation of 2 K around 300 K
Process temperature [K]	float	generated using a random walk process normalized to a standard deviation of 1 K, added to the air temperature plus 10 K.
Rotational speed [rpm]	int	calculated from a power of 2860 W, overlaid with a normally distributed noise
Torque [Nm]	 	float	torque values are normally distributed around 40 Nm with a If = 10 Nm and no negative values.
Tool wear [min]		int	The quality variants H/M/L add 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear to the used tool in the process. and a
'machine failure' label that indicates, whether the machine has failed in this particular datapoint for any of the following failure modes are true.
Machine failure		int
TWF			int	tool wear failure
HDF			int	heat dissipation failure
PWF			int	power failure
OSF			int	overstrain failure
RNF			int	random failures
