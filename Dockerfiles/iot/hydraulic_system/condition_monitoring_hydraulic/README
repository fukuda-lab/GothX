Data Set Information:

The data set was experimentally obtained with a hydraulic test
rig. This test rig consists of a primary working and a secondary
cooling-filtration circuit which are connected via the oil tank [1],
[2]. The system cyclically repeats constant load cycles (duration 60
seconds) and measures process values such as pressures, volume flows
and temperatures while the condition of four hydraulic components
(cooler, valve, pump and accumulator) is quantitatively varied.

Multiple files, each file:
Fields separator "\t"
Decimal separator "."

Each row is a single cycle 60s

MODIFICATIONS:
Files with sampling rate > 1Hz have been resampled to 1Hz to save
space and reduce data volume using:

import numpy as np
import scipy.signal

def resample(fname):
    data = np.loadtxt(fname, delimiter="\t")
    print(data.shape)
    resampled = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: scipy.signal.resample(x, 60), 1, data)
    print(resampled.shape)
    save_fname = fname.replace(".", "_resampled.")
    np.savetxt(save_fname, resampled, fmt="%.2f", delimiter="\t")

files = ["PS1.txt", "PS2.txt", "PS3.txt", "PS4.txt", "PS5.txt", "PS6.txt", "EPS1.txt", "FS1.txt", "FS2.txt"]
