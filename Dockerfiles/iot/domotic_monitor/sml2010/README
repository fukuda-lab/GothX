Data Set Information:

This dataset is collected from a monitor system mounted in a domotic
house. It corresponds to approximately 40 days of monitoring data.
The dataset could contain missing values. The data was sampled every
minute, computing and uploading it smoothed with 15 minute means. The
header of the data file is a commentary (begins with #) indicating
which data is stored at which column (in Spanish). The data is time
information is in UTC.
