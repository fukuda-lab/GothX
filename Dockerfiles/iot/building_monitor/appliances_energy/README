Data Set Information:

The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature
and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor
network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity
conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10
minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with
m-bus energy meters. Weather from the nearest airport weather station
(Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from
Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru), and merged together with the experimental
data sets using the date and time column. Two random variables have
been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to
filter out non predictive attributes (parameters).

For more information about the house, data collection, R scripts and
figures, please refer to the paper and to the following github
