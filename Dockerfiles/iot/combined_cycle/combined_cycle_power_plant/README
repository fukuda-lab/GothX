Data Set Information:

The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle
Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to
work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient
variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity
(RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical
energy output (EP) of the plant.  A combined cycle power plant (CCPP)
is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat
recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by
gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is
transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is colected
from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, he other three of the
ambient variables effect the GT performance.  For comparability with
our baseline studies, and to allow 5x2 fold statistical tests be
carried out, we provide the data shuffled five times. For each
shuffling 2-fold CV is carried out and the resulting 10 measurements
are used for statistical testing.  We provide the data both in .ods
and in .xlsx formats.
